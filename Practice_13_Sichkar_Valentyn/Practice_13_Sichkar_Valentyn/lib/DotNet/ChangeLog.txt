Change Log
----------

This represents a summary of additions, changes and removals for the 0.3.1 release of dotNetRDF

Added
- New RdfXmlWriter which is a streaming writer based on FastRdfXmlWriter
- New Writing.Formatting namespaces
 - Introduces ITripleFormatter, INodeFormatter, IUriFormatter and ICharFormatter interfaces
 - Provides an easy to use and reusable means of formatting nodes and triples
 - Refactored existing code to use formatters for writing
- New Parsing.Validation namespace
 - Provides simple classes for validating syntax
- SPARQL Views
 - Create Graphs which are dynamically generated from a SPARQL Query and updated when the underlying data changes/on demand
- Silverlight Compatability
 - Emulated HtmlTextWriter and HttpUtility for Silverlight compatability
 - Variety of compiler symbols defined to allow various library features to be disabled
 - SparqlXmlParser and SparqlXmlWriter use XmlReader and XmlWriter respectively when no XML DOM API available
 - TriXParser and TriXWriter use XmlReader and XmlWriter respectively when no XML DOM API available

Changed
- Bug Fixes
 - SqlTripleStore initialises correctly and persists updates correctly when used with an ISparqlUpdateProcessor
 - More intelligent parsing of Blank Node IDs from SPARQL Results
 - TriG Writer outputs all required @prefix definitions and generates consistent QNames
 - URI Loader Cache handles File IO errors gracefully
 - Rare forms of Numeric Literals now supported by Turtle, N3, TriG and SPARQL Parsers
 - Potentially ambigious QNames and Plain Literals now no longer cause parsing errors in Turtle, N3, TriG and SPARQL Parsers
 - DESCRIBE query results are received correctly from Sesame
 - Using UpdateGraph() to delete Triples from Sesame/AllegroGraph deletes the correct Triples not the entire context
- General Improvements
 - INamespaceMapper interface extracted and some visibility changes to NamespaceMapper methods
 - Options.UriLoaderTimeout for controlling UriLoader Timeout
 - Most parsers generate more helpful error messages for various error conditions and much more frequently attach Position Information to errors
- SPARQL Improvements
 - Optimisations for ASK queries
 - Optimisations for CONSTRUCT/DESCRIBE/SELECT where LIMIT/OFFSET is used
 - SparqlXmlWriter uses streamed writing to allow it to produce output much faster using much less memory
- ASP.Net Improvements
 - Better caching support for BaseGraphHandler - now sends ETag in responses and may respond with 304 Not Modified as appropriate

Removed
- Obsolete RdfXmlWriter removed
